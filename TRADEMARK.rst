Flutter Mumbai Trademark Usage Policy
===============================


*Version 1.0.0*

Introduction
------------

This document outlines the policy of Flutter Mumbai regarding the use of its trademarks. Any use of any Flutter Mumbai trademark must be in accordance with this policy.

All trademarks, even those that apply to open source software, must be used according to certain legal requirements. If these requirements are not met, the trademark may be endangered or lost. One of these requirements is for the trademark owner to maintain standards for using its trademarks and to enforce acceptable use of the trademarks by taking action against parties that violate those standards.

Trademark law is mainly a way to protect the public, rather than the trademark holder. This means that uses of trademarks that confuse consumers -- which in our case would include our developer and user community, or anyone else who might be likely to be involved with or support Flutter Mumbai -- are not permitted under law. As the owner of the trademark, the Flutter Mumbai must be sure the mark is used properly, so the community is not confused. That is what the  Flutter Mumbai means when it's said that an unpoliced trademark may be endangered or lost. When the trademark no longer represents a certain level of quality to the community or no longer indicates that the  Flutter Mumbai is the source of the products that bear the trademark, the trademark loses its value.

Underlying Flutter Mumbai's trademark policy is a set of guidelines for what is -- and is not -- acceptable use of Flutter Mumbai's trademarks, specifically the word mark "Flutter Mumbai", the Flutter Mumbai logos, and variations of those marks. This policy describes the uses generally approved by Flutter Mumbai for its trademarks. However, if you violate this policy, or otherwise take actions that may compromise the goodwill or trademarks of Flutter Mumbai, or expose Flutter Mumbai to liability, Flutter Mumbai may require you to cease all use of any Flutter Mumbai trademark, regardless of the uses allowed in this policy.

General Goals
------------

In general, we want the word mark "Flutter Mumbai" and the Flutter Mumbai logos to be used with minimal restriction to refer to the Flutter Mumbai community group.

We do not want these trademarks to be used:
to refer to any other community group
in a way that is misleading or may imply association of unrelated groups, communities, tools, documentation, or other resources with Flutter Mumbai.
## Uses that Never Require Approval
All trademarks are subject to "nominative use rules" that allow the use of the trademark to name the trademarked entity in a way that is minimal and does not imply a sponsorship relationship with the trademark holder.

## Uses that Always Require Approval
Any commercial use of the Flutter Mumbai trademarks in product or company names must be approved first by Flutter Mumbai. Some uses, like calling a company "The Flutter Mumbai Company," or a product "Flutter Mumbai Software" or "Flutter Mumbai IDE" will be refused. This is because they are overly broad, or confusing as to whether the Flutter framework is open-source or commercial, or whether your product or organization is affiliated with or sponsored by Flutter Mumbai.

Any use of a derived (modified) logo for any commercial purpose must also be approved first by Flutter Mumbai. We will generally be unable to do this, because of the confusion it may cause.

How to Use the assets.
----------------------

Although many uses of Flutter Mumbai's assets are governed by more specific rules, which appear in the examples below, the following basic guidelines apply to almost any use of Flutter Mumbai's assets.

The font to be used while mentioning Flutter Mumbai and its assets is `Google Sans <https://github.com/FlutterMumbai/FlutterMumbai_Assets/tree/master/Fonts>`_
The main logo should only be modified with the approval of the Flutter Mumbai team.
Always use any trademark as an adjective only, with a capitalized "F" and capitalized "M". For instance, it is correct to refer to the community as "Flutter Mumbai" (adjective) but not flutter mumbai   (all lowercase), flutter Mumbai  (lowercase "F"), Flutter mumbai (lowercase "M"), or "the Flutter Mumbai" (noun). Don't use the trademark as a verb ("Flutter Mumbai your community today!").

Examples
--------

We have specific rules for the following uses:
Use of the word "Flutter Mumbai" in text, or as text in 3rd party logos and trademarks.
Use of one of the Flutter Mumbai-provided logo variants in unaltered form.

Helping Out
-----------

As a member of the Flutter Mumbai community, please keep an eye out for questionable uses of the Flutter Mumbai logo and "Flutter Mumbai" word mark. You can report potential misuse to the [Flutter Mumbai](mailto:fluttermum@gmail.com). We will evaluate each case and take appropriate action.

Please do not approach users of the assets with a complaint. That should be left to the Flutter Mumbai leadership and its representatives.

Thanks!

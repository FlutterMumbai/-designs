# Flutter Mumbai Assets

This repository is for all assets, logos, etc. used for Flutter Mumbai. Please read our full [Trademark Usage Policy](TRADEMARK.rst)

Flutter Mumbai and its logo are trademarks of the [Flutter Mumbai Community]().

In general, we want the logo to be used as widely as possible to indicate the support of or involvement with Flutter Mumbai. If you are a local Flutter Mumbai leader, you are free to adapt the logo to your location. However, non-leaders, please [ask](mailto:fluttermum@gmail.com) first when using a derived version of the logo or when in doubt.


## The Flutter Mumbai Logo

The standard Flutter Mumbai logo can be found in the logo folder (formats: .png,.svg). You can remove the outside circle of the logo or you also can change the color of the circle. You can't alter the colors of the main logo and you can change the size of the logo according to the requirement.


If you have any queries [reach out us](mailto:fluttermum@gmail.com).
